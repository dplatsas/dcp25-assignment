# Description of the project

This project processes ABC music notation files from multiple book directories, extracts tune metadata, stores it in a SQLite database, and provides an interactive interface for querying and analyzing the music collection.

# Instructions for use

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
3. Run the program: `python abc_parser.py`
4. Use the menu to query tunes by book, type, or title

# How it works:

1. **File Processing**: Recursively scans `abc_books` directory for ABC files
2. **Parsing**: Extracts tune metadata (title, type, key) using ABC notation headers
3. **Database Storage**: Stores parsed data in SQLite database with book numbers
4. **Analysis**: Uses pandas for data analysis and querying
5. **Interface**: Provides menu-driven user interface for data exploration
